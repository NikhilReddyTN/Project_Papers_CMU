# Project_Papers_CMU
This repository contain research project papers from my masters Program at Carnegie Mellon University.

Projects:
1. Adversarial Training for Robust Vision-Language Reasoning
   -Applied FGSM to visual and textual embeddings in the ViLT transformer to simulate adversarial conditions and enhance model robustness
   -Strengthened ViLT’s robustness on the NLVR2 benchmark by introducing targeted embedding-level perturbations
   -Improved accuracy of baseline ViLT model by 1.4% on NLVR2 benchmark while increasing resistance to perturbations
2. RAG Re-ranking with Prompt Compression
   -Constructed a RAG pipeline integrating prompt compression using a Large Language Model between retrieval and re-ranking stages optimizing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy
   -Implemented static and dynamic compression strategies, including cosine similarity–based adaptive compression for query-relevant documents
   -Achieved 17.6% faster inference while maintaining 95%+ ranking quality on TREC benchmarks
3. Prompt-Based Localized Image Editing
   -Enhanced instruction-based image editing by implementing segmentation-guided object localization, improving editing precision for targeted objects
   -Integrated GroundingDINO and SAM to enable accurate object-specific edits from natural language prompts
   -Attained targeted improvements in specific editing scenarios while preserving contextual awareness
